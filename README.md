# YCHR

YCHR aims to become a modern and modular
[CHR](https://sp2.informatik.uni-ulm.de/fruehwirth/constraint-handling-rules-book.html) compiler
with support for multiple host languages.

YCHR is implemented in Haskell.

The compilation strategy is based on
Peter Van Weert, Pieter Wuille, Tom Schrijvers, Bart Demoen. 2008.
_CHR for imperative host languages_.

## Planned features

- [ ] Module system Ã  la SWI Prolog.
- [ ] Compilation to an intermediate imperative DSL to abstract over the various backends.
- [ ] Minimal interpreter with few predefined built-in constraints.
- [ ] Scheme backend.
- [ ] JavaScript backend.
- [ ] Some of the performance optimizations described in _CHR for imperative host languages_.
- [ ] Rule tracing.
- [ ] Standard library.

## Wishlist

- [ ] A library for frontend programming with the JavaScript backend.
- [ ] Static type-checker.
- [ ] More performance optimizations.
- [ ] Visual tools to debug and inspect the runtime.
- [ ] Meta-programming via the interpreter.
- [ ] Haskell integration through TemplateHaskell.
- [ ] Alternative concurrent semantics.
- [ ] Erlang backend.
- [ ] Aggregates, as described in Van Weert et al. 2008. _Aggregates for CHR through program transformation_.
